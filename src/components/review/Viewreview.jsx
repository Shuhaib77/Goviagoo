              I recently spent two weeks in Nepal and it was one of the most
              memorable trips of my life. The people were incredibly friendly
              and welcoming, and I was amazed by the beauty of the natural
              landscape. The highlight of my trip was trekking in the Himalayas.
              The views were simply breathtaking and the experience of reaching
              the Everest Base Camp was truly unforgettable. I also spent a day
              in Chitwan National Park.
